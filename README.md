# SlaveVM Monitoring System *under construction*
## Project Description
### The SlaveVM Monitoring System is a comprehensive suite of Python scripts designed for effective monitoring and management of virtual machines (VMs). This robust and flexible platform handles various aspects of VM operation, including creation, configuration, backup, and reporting.

## Key Features
1. Virtual Machine Management: Scripts like create.py for VM creation, setup, and lifecycle management.
2. Environment Activation and Management: Scripts such as activate_this.py and _virtualenv.py for managing virtual environments.
3. Backup Operations: The back_up.py script for data backup and disaster recovery.
4. User Interface for Secure Operations: request_pass_gui.py indicates a graphical interface for secure operations.
5. Comprehensive Utility Tools: util.py provides a range of utilities supporting the monitoring system.
6. Logging and Metadata Management: Scripts like _setuptools_logging.py and metadata.py for detailed logging and metadata handling.
7. Main Control Scripts: main.py and __main__.py serve as central control mechanisms for the system.
## System Architecture
The system is modular, with directories containing scripts for specific functionalities within the VM monitoring ecosystem. This design makes it ideal for integration into larger management frameworks.

## Target Users
Ideal for system administrators, IT professionals, and DevOps engineers requiring automated VM monitoring and management.

## Technologies Used
Built primarily in Python, leveraging libraries and frameworks for scripting and automation. The use of virtual environments underscores a focus on dependency management and isolated runtime environments.
